# compchem-scripts

In this repository, me and my group members will be adding and improving a variety of short scripts that we use throughout our work with computational chemistry programs. The idea is to freely share usefull pieces of codes that help us and may help others without the need to search the web for answers how to do one thing. Or spending an afternoon trying to save 1 minutes each day. Another reason for this internal project is that it will help us communicate and organize our work. Ideally, each script should be properly anotated for which code and version is is used, as well as testing the robustness, i.e., if the script works the same regardless of the calculation type in a given version.

Currently, the scripts are expected to be used for data extraction, progress monitoring, data processing, and plotting. Occasionally some scripts for analysing structures etc. may be added.

Codes currently used:
Gaussian 16
Orca 6.x.x
FHI-AIMS 25
Amber26
Fireball-qmd

Languages used:
bash
Python 3
